    <p id = about>This is the official website for your future duck purchase. All nine ducks on sale come from a special room, defined by the walls of BSSA building, in Amsterdam. Each duck tells a different story of its owner. That is why each duck is called by the name of its owner. By owning this duck, you do not own the owner. Click on "Gallery" page to meet all the ducks available.</p>
    
    <p id= who> <em>The duckdea was born and raised in that special room of BSSA, collectively by Tommie van Heusen, Livio Nocchi, and Maisa ImamoviÄ‡. <br> For further information and conversation, refer to "Contact" page.</em></p>
